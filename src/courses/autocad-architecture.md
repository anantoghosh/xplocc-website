AutoCAD Architecture is one of the mechanisms available in one AutoCAD. Architecture is one of a specialized toolset that allows engineering and construction professionals to build more detailed and structured drawings. Basic arcs and lines are recouped by creative walls, windows and doors with the aid of AutoCAD. 
Learning CAD gives you a concept of how layout is made for any shape or equipment. It means that this software enables you to design a building, create an architectural framework and do research about the capacity of the buildings to be built on a physical site.

## Significance of AutoCAD Architecture

Working on AutoCAD helps save time and efforts because of the commands like mirror, copy, rotate, rotate scale and many more such commands. It offers accuracy in all amplitude which is next to impossible in manual hand-made drawings. It defines exactness to any number of decimal places. By the help of this, software designers can apply animations in the design, see the actual work and can make the required changes accordingly, if needed. This not only helps the designer to improve the speed but also benefits by completing the project in time.
One of the important features about it is that we can make number of changes and revisions simply and speedily. It makes the work easier as the designs of the building can be spend through mail, which also shows the blueprint of the design. These software files employ less space as compared to manually made paper sketches. AutoCAD also benefits in making 3d models with the help of colors, textures etc making them bright and uncomplicated for customer to foresee the end product.
## Who should attend
•	Professionals, graduates, technologists , students , researchers and many others who wants to build more detailed and structured drawings. 

•	One willing  to design a building, create an architectural framework and do research about the capacity of the buildings to be built on a physical site.
This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of AutoCAD Architecture. It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with AutoCAD Architecture.
