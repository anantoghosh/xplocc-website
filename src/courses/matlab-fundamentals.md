MATLAB stands for matrix laboratory. It is a high-performance language which is particularly used for technical computing. It widely includes visualization, programming and computation. MATLAB is used for work in an easy-to-use environment where solutions and problems are expressed in mathematical notations. This widely includes engineering and scientific graphics, developing applications including graphical users interface building, simulation, prototyping, modelling, mathematical computation and algorithmic development. The basic data element in MATLAB is an array that doesn’t require dimensioning. It gives you a great help in solving many technical computing problems, especially including matrix and vector formulation and that also in fractions of time.
In higher educational institutes, MATLAB is the standard instructional tool for teaching advanced courses in mathematics, engineering and science. MATLAB features a bundle of applications specific solutions called toolboxes. A MATLAB user is well known of the term ‘toolboxes’ because toolbox allows us to apply and learn specialized technology. Toolbox includes neural networks, wavelets, fuzzy logic, signal processing and simulation.
## The significance of MATLAB
MATLAB allows us to have easy numerical calculations and visualization without the need of advanced and time consuming programs. MATLAB provides a great variety of techniques and functions for graphical display of data. MATLAB plotting tools make it more flexible and easy to use. You can use your own functions for use in MATLAB. These functions are implemented in M-files.
The MATLAB graphics system includes programming for two-dimensional and three-dimensional data visualization, animation and image processing. This feature of MATLAB is very useful in today’s cinematography and high quality videos. MATLAB function library has a wide range of computational algorithms starting from elementary functions like sum, difference, multiplication, trigonometric ratios to more complex like inverse matrix, Fourier Transform and Bessel functions. So, it can be used as advanced calculator.
## Who should attend
•	One willing to work with matrices and mathematical equations for technical computing that  includes visualization, programming and computation.

•	Graduates , technologists , students and many others who want to solve their problems using mathematical  equation and wants the graphical representation of outcomes .
This course is aimed for both who have and do not have prior knowledge pf MATLAB and its fundamentals . It is beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with MATLAB and its application industry.
