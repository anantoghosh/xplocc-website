## About Matlab
Matrix Laboratory or Matlab is a comprehensive programming environment incorporating libraries, integrated development environment and its own language for programming. The real programming language of Matlab is high-level which signifies that there is no need to fret about the low level of functionality. It is a strong and sophistical tool that can be utilized for the development of real time data processing models and swift prototyping. Matlab is used as a brilliant tool in matrix calculations, developing data visualization and user interfaces, and running and developing algorithms. The multi-paradigm environment lets the developer to interface with the programs so that the unique strengths of every language can be harnessed for a plethora of purposes. 
## Significance of Matlab
Matlab is been utilized by the scientists and engineers in a wide assortment of fields including signal processing, industry control systems, computational finance, communications, smart grid design as well as robotics. It comes along with an interface environment and a ranging section of toolboxes so that a user can connect to a distinctive hardware platform and that too under one workbench. As a result, a user can connect to a number of embedded platforms, whether they are closed sourced or open sourced. 
## Embedded systems with Matlab
Matlab offers a tool that is useful to the engineers in modeling the dynamic systems. Matlab can also be utilized by the testing or developing embedded systems via its instrument control toolbox. This makes it quite convenient for the user to test the embedded systems by offering him control over a number of programmable instruments. As a whole, Matlab tools are effective in the development of embedded systems. 
## Who should attend
•	Professionals, students, researchers and many others who wants to develop a real time data processing models and swift prototyping.

•	One willing to work on signal processing, industry control systems, computational finance, communications, smart grid design as well as robotics.
