## About the MATLAB
Developed by MathWorks, MATLAB is a fourth-gen programming language and numerical analysis environment. It is also termed as a high-level computing language and interactive environment that is used for computer programming, numerical computation and visualization. In short, MATLAB is a computing environment that is completely based on multi-level paradigm. 
MATLAB is used on a wide scale in terms of research and education at colleges/universities, applied math and in a plethora of industrial verticals. You can design and develop various algorithms, analyze data deeply and can create a myriad of applications and models with the help of MATLAB. 
MATLAB, being a programming language contains several tools and some in-built mathematical functionalities that help the user with the rapid access of the solution with the assistance of a number of approaches when taken in comparison with conventional programming languages and spread sheets.
Scientists and Engineers were in a hunt of programming language that lets them portray their array and matrix in mathematics. MATALAB is a platform that assists Scientists and Engineers while letting them easily express the following. 
The linear Algebra in the MATLAB is just the same as compared to the Linear Algebra in the textbooks. The same thing implies to the image and signal processing, data analytics and control design. The astonishing fact is that Scientists have a huge trust on MATLAB that they rely on MATLAB for sending the spacecrafts to other planets and also assists patients of match transplant with suitable organ donors.
## What is the need of MATLAB?
Digital computation, Mathematical simulation and modeling have always been the most complex part of some engineering disciplines incorporating Automobile, Aerospace, Control System Domain, Computational Science and Embedded System. And with the help of MATLAB these things seem easier, and that’s the main reason why it is considered as an Industrial Standard.
If there’s something that’s easy to use and is extremely useful while making things go easier for you, then it’s none other than MATLAB. You can transform the things according to you using MATLAB say- video/audio procession and other elements that are associated with DSP can be easily imitated with the help of MATLAB.
You will always feel that there’s much more you can do with MATLAB. You can take in use of the tools like Image Processing that’s fun to use and much more convenient. MATLAB also provisions several benefits to the ECE field by making things easier like plotting graphs, dealing with waveforms and the responses of system.

## Who should attend
•	One willing to work on computer programming, numerical computation and visualization and want to analyze data deeply and can create a myriad of applications and models with the help of MATLAB.

•	Scientists, Engineers , professors and many others who wants to process the image and want to extract some useful data from pictures or want to modify the image. Digital computation, Mathematical simulation and modeling can also be done using MATLAB.
This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of MATLAB. It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with MATLAB and its application industry.
