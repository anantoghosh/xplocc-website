Revit is a renowned software owned by Autodesk that builds information modeling. Autodesk is also the owner of the other famous software named as AutoCAD. When a building is digitally modeled prior to its on-site construction, the process is termed as Building Information Modeling. The software does this in the same manner and is utilized by a myriad of the construction industry members such as MEP consultants, engineers, contractors, architects etc. for documenting and designing a building.
While it is not feasible in AutoCAD, a building can be virtually modeled in Revit including information to be utilized for several processes of construction such as clash coordination, quantity, analysis etc. Revit incorporates more efficiency in terms of managing and collaborating information.
## The significance of Revit
Revit offers an unlimited career scope as every day there is a construction of a new building. It is very crucial to build a prior model so that when it has got a green signal, the model can be developed without any flaws. Students that have an architectural background can easily compete in the market if they have a suitable know-how of Revit. Even a pro in architecture, can get advanced exposure and career boost by learning Revit.
Building a model without much complexities and in a confined time is pretty easy when one knows Revit. A user can also work in coordination with the team members as multiple-user provision is available that offers a myriad of advantages including more quality and efficiency in work, savings in time and many others. 
## Who should attend
•	MEP consultants, engineers, contractors, architects , architecture student and many others who wants to model a building digitally before its on-site construction.

•	This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of Revit. It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with Revit.
