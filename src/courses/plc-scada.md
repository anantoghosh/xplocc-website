## About PLC SCADA
Programmable logic controller (PLS) is the essential component of industrial process control and factory automation. It supervises a broad range of applications from basic function of light to environmental system to plants processed by the chemicals. Such system performs several functions by giving a variety of digital and analog input and output interfaces; various communication protocols, signal processing and data conversion. All functionalities and components of PLC’s are positioned nearby the controller, which is automated for a particular task.
SCADA is not a particular technology, rather a sort of application. The application software of SCADA runs on machine connected to peripheral devices and several PLCs. It offers a better control and effective observing of plant. SCADA enables controllers or engineers to interact in a prominent way with working parts of a plant. 
## Significance of PLC with SCADA
The whole automation field is now emphasizing on PLC and SCADA (also known as HMI). Previously, Microprocessor or Relay logic was utilized for the purpose of control, yet nowadays it is carried out by PLC due to high flexibility and reliability offered by PLC. Let’s say in an industry the client desires to alter the logic after a while. It is not convenient to do that in Microprocessor or Relay logic but in the case of PLC, it can be achieved easily. Now a PLC and SCADA are utilized in automation, building and home. Therefore, it is clear that SCADA and PLC is the vital solution for regulatory purposes where there is a requirement of tailored solutions. PLC SCADA with IOT application has proved to be a revolutionary technique in the industry emerging consistently to lead a better future. 
## Who should attend
•	One willing to work in the field of industrial process control and factory automation.

•	 professionals, graduates, engineers, and many others who wants to work on system that performs several functions by giving a variety of digital and analog input and output interfaces; various communication protocols, signal processing and data conversion.   
This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of  PLC with SCADA  . It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with PLC with SCADA  and its application industry.
