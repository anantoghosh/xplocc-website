## About Robotics using Arduino
Robotics is a field of engineering that includes the manufacture, conception, designing and operation of robots. This branch of science overlay with artificial intelligence, electronics, mechatronics, nanotechnology, computer science and bioengineering. The stream of robotics usually includes focusing on how any bodily constructed system of technology can do a task or can perform a role in any new technology or interface. Robotics is an emerging and interesting field. Several folks are anticipating to learn making robots, but the point of commencement is hard to find specifically for a layman. If you are already aware of programming concepts and electronics, it is a good idea to learn robotics with Arduino. Your basic would be clear with it and that will help you later on in building superior robotic projects. 
## Significance of Robotics using Arduino 
Arduino is capable to perform almost every supposable project. It is being used by industries, engineers, students and hobbits in various projects and applications. The software of Arduino is convenient to use for learners, yet capable enough to meet the demand of the advanced users. It can run on various platforms such as Linux, Max and Windows. Since its launch in the initial 2000s, Arduino products such as Nano and Uno have transformed what folks can build at home with economical and user-friendly components. You can directly program the microcontroller with boot-loader by connecting the panel to the system without any help of costly programmers. With the help of pre-design shields, program libraries and Arduino board, you can even make robots in a shorter span of time
## Who should attend
•	One who wants to work in the field of  manufacturing , conception, designing and operation of robots.

•	Professionals, students , technologists, researchers and many others who will be dealing with artificial intelligence, electronics, mechatronics, nanotechnology, computer science and bio-engineering.
This course aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of Robotics using Arduino . It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with Robotics with Arduino .
