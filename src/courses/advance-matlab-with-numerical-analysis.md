Scientists and mathematicians worldwide are using MATLAB for their research and complex calculations. In mathematics, we opt for a method that solves continuous problems using numeric approximations called numerical analysis. In this we design such method that gives us approximations, which is useful in such cases where exact solution is quite impossible and very time consuming. Numerical Analysis also involves accuracy, less time consumption, stability and characterizes the computational complexity. 
MATLAB is majorly used in numerical analysis in engineering and computational finance. It gives us a wide gamut of numerical methods for differential and integration, interpolation, extrapolation and regression, linear system of equations, ODEs, PDEs and many more. So, basically MATLAB has great advantage in numerical analysis.
## The significance of MATLAB Advance with Numerical Analysis
Numerical analysis is used where there are complex calculations and are very time consuming. When after a very hectic and complex calculation, you didn’t find an accurate solutions there you can go for these methods. In higher technical studies or in higher educational institutes, MATLAB tools are used for example in calculating differentiation, integration, vector calculus, linear system of equation and many others. Scientists use MATLAB tools in their research and discoveries. Many research and development centres use this for their higher technical calculation for accurate and fast calculations.
You can also perform quadrature, fast Fourier transform, optimisation and linear programming with the help of MATLAB product family. Moreover, you can design and implement your own numerical methods using built-in support for vector and matrix operations in the MATLAB language.
## Who should attend
•	One willing to work with matrices and mathematical equations and use these equations and matrices to solve real time problem.

•	Technologists , professionals, graduates , students and many others who will be dealing with complex calculations and researches .
This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of MATLAB and numerical analysis . It is beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with MATLAB and numerical analysis.
