There is a technique which is used to convert an image into digital format and perform operations on it to get an enhanced version of it or extracting some useful information from it; which is called image processing. Image processing is the technique that came into the picture from contributions of many different branches of science including mathematics, physics, electrical engineering and optical engineering. Image processing involves many different steps such as importing the image with an optical scanner, manipulating the image, analysing the image and then generating the desired output image. 
Using MATLAB, the image processing has become more enhanced and advanced. The IPT i.e. image processing technique is the set of all the functions that widens the proficiency of the numeric computing environment of MATLAB. It gives us the workflow applications and standard algorithms for visualisation, analysis, image processing and algorithm development.
## The significance of IPT
IPT contributes a lot in enhancing the quality of image. MATLAB can be used to perform image enhancement, noise reduction, 3D image processing and geometric transformations. It finds various uses in the field of medicines, military, industries, consumer electronics and many more.
In medicine, it is used for diagnostics purposes i.e. in digital radiography, computerised axial tomography (CAT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  In industries, it has wide use in manufacturing system such as quality control, safety system and automated guided vehicle control. In military services, it is used to detect soldiers and vehicles, in missile guidance, reconnaissance and object recognition.  And in consumer electronic, it is used in digital cameras and camcorders, monitors, high definition TVs, personal video recorders, cell phones, DVDs etc.

## Who should attend
•	One who really want to perform different different operations on images and modify them as per their need.

•	Professionals/students/graduates and many others who has great interest in MATLAB and want to extract some information from images or want to process that image to get enhanced version of that image.
This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have any prior knowledge of Image processing . It is beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with both MATLAB and Image processing .
