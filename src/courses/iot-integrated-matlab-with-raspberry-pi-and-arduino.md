## About IoT integrated MATLAB with Raspberry pi & Arduino
The Internet of Things is supposed to dramatically transform the way folks interact with the present-day technology. It is fundamentally going to transform the way of life. The IoT growth has been rising from the past decade and is all set to reach the skies within a few years, with both consumers and organizations attuning to smart technology. The technology is on the verge to hit the mainstream. 
By the integration of MATLAB (a simulation and programming platform) with IoT, a person can organize mathematical data in a more enhanced manner. An exclusive cloud platform- ThingSpeak developed by Mathworks lets the user manage multifarious fields for an efficient analytics and visualization. The giant toolbox library of MATLAB allows an easy connection with the open source microcontroller platforms including Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The user can gain a comprehensive know-how about using Raspberry Pi board, Arduino board with the wi-fi module, customization of ThingSpeak and learning android application development via Matlab for more productive real-time projects.
## The essence of learning IoT integrated MATLAB with Raspberry Pi and Arduino 
The IoT has the potentiality to transform the whole world. It will play a significant part in the upcoming period. More than 50% of the core business systems and processes are going to incorporate the elements of IoT in the business by the year 2020. The impact of the technology on corporate business models and the lives of the consumers is escalating at a fast pace as the expenses of instrumenting sensors with physical objects and their connection to the other systems and devices are dropping down. 
Since the complete realization of the IoT sector is yet to be done, knowledge about the core of the IoT sector assists the learners to become a more preferred choice among several companies and let their rationality reach a wider scope for diversifying the entrepreneurship culture and addressing the short comings associated with the future.
