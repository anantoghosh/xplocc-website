## About Raspberry Pi 
Raspberry Pi is a cost-effective computer that has the size of a credit card. It can be plugged into a television or a computer monitor and utilizes mouse and a standard keyboard. This potential petty device enables folks to learn language programming such as Python and Scratch as well as explore computing. The capability of Raspberry Pi is similar to a desktop computer where one can play HD videos, make spreadsheets, surf the internet and do word processing. 
It is not all! This little device can interact with the outer world and is been utilized in a plethora of digital maker projects including weather stations, parent detectors and music machines. It has distinctive generation models named as p1 (2012-2014) , p2 (2015) and p3 (2016). 
## The significance of Raspberry Pi
Though Raspberry Pi consists of a small size, it functions as a usual computer and that too at a lesser price range. It is feasible to function as a low-priced server to manage the web traffic. Grouping Raspberry Pi’s to function as one server is lighter on the pocket than a usual server. If each and every light traffic server is modified into Raspberry Pi, the budget of an enterprise might certainly minimize.
Raspberry Pi presents various job opportunities as well for the professionals and the beginners. The control robotic and remote monitoring developed in this platform includes a splendid academic and industrial value. Even the grossing and evolving next-gen technology ‘IOT’ is employing Raspberry Pi at a higher percentage. 
## Embedded systems with Raspberry Pi
There are several sorts of embedded systems- from multi CPU to the petty 8 bit microcontrollers. Raspberry Pi can be utilized for gaining knowledge about the typical embedded systems such as I2C, Serial, SPI Interfaces and GPO. It is also very effective for learning embedded systems from a novice point of view since it is a low-priced source of development and convenient to use. 
## Who should attend
•	Students, engineers, graduates and many others who wants to play HD videos, make spreadsheets, surf the internet and do word processing.

•	This course is aimed for both those who have and do not have prior knowledge of Embedded system with Raspberry Pi. It is a beginner to advanced course to familiarize you with Embedded system with Raspberry Pi and its application industry.
