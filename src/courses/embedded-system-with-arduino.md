## About Arduino 
Arduino is referred to as an open-source electronic platform that is developed for the ease of accessibility of the electronics to designers, hobbyists, artists and other individuals who want to develop interactive environments and objects. One can purchase an arduino board in a pre-assembled format since it incorporates an open- source and hand- built hardware design. A pre-assembled board comprises of a development environment and a microcontroller that can be programmed via the programming language of Arduino. 
With its intensive and vast application, Arduino’s comprehensive usage can range from daily objects to the compounded industrial projects. 
## The significance of Arduino
The essence of Arduino can be ascertained by its use in a myriad of applications and projects by several industries, engineers, academics, students etc. Whether you are a novice to the software or an advanced user, Arduino is malleable enough to be used by all sorts of individuals. Though a number of Arduino projects might appear to be frivolous, the technology taps into multiple trends that makes it a significant force in the market. This brilliant open source project minimizes the entry barrier for the developers who look forward to experimenting with the synergistic objects. It helps in offering a new wave of opportunities for startups and techies to develop smart technical stuff. The requirement of pricey programmers will now cease to exist as the microcontroller can be directly coded via boot loader by connecting it to a system. A time will come where one would even be able to design robots through this platform. 
## Embedded systems with Arduino 
Embedded system refers to a computer embedded in a machine or some large device for performing controlled and automated tasks. The major embedded systems utilize peripherals with microcontrollers for communicating with the outside world. 
Talking about Arduino on the other hand, it’s a board that amalgamates the additional circuitry with a microcontroller to upload programs. Arduino is easy to use, yet an embedded engineer can only work on embedded systems. Arduino can be utilized to create prototypes or embedded systems quickly and easily.
