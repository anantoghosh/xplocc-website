Hypervisor technology is a software on which numerous implicit machines can run, with the
hypervisor layer governing the hardware and allocating resources to each VM operating
system. It further helps you create software version of a computer which is called a virtual
machine .In some structures, it also helps the operating system running in the virtual machines
to have direct contact with storage hardware, networking and graphics. With the support of
Hyper V, you can run more than a single virtual machine on the same hardware at the same
time.

implementing a virtualization framework. Every IT department has started using it and places
like government authorities and hospitals would also majorly benefit from virtual machines.

## Who should Attend ?
